{"question": "Tom has 3 apples and buys 2 more. How many apples does he have now?", "answer": "Tom has 5 apples now.", "explanation": "Sure! Let's break down the problem step-by-step so that it's easy to understand.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the initial amount of apples\nFirst, we need to find out how many apples Tom starts with. According to the question, Tom has **3 apples**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the amount of apples Tom buys\nNext, we need to look at how many more apples Tom buys. The question states that he buys **2 more apples**.\n\n### Step 3: Set up the addition\nNow, we need to find the total number of apples Tom has after buying the additional apples. To do this, we will add the number of apples he initially has to the number of apples he buys.\n\n### Step 4: Write the addition equation\nWe can write the equation as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total apples} = \\text{Initial apples} + \\text{Apples bought}\n\\]\nSubstituting the numbers we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Total apples} = 3 + 2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Perform the addition\nNow, we need to calculate the sum:\n\\[\n3 + 2 = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: State the final answer\nAfter performing the addition, we find that Tom has a total of **5 apples** now.\n\n### Conclusion\nSo, to summarize:\n- Tom started with 3 apples.\n- He bought 2 more apples.\n- When we add them together (3 + 2), we find that Tom now has **5 apples**.\n\nFinal Answer: Tom has 5 apples now.", "feedback": "Yes", "suggestion": "", "refined_answer": ""}
{"question": "Chris is inviting 82 friends to a party. He has 1804 cookies and 10 peices of candy,How many cookies will each friend get?", "answer": "Each friend will get 22 cookies.", "explanation": "To solve the problem of how many cookies each of Chris's 82 friends will get, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nChris has a total of 1804 cookies and he wants to share them equally among his 82 friends. We need to find out how many cookies each friend will receive.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Division\nTo find out how many cookies each friend gets, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of friends. The mathematical expression for this is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cookies per friend} = \\frac{\\text{Total cookies}}{\\text{Number of friends}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute the Values\nNow, we can substitute the values we have into the expression. We know that Chris has 1804 cookies and 82 friends:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cookies per friend} = \\frac{1804}{82}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Division\nNext, we need to perform the division. We can do this either by long division or using a calculator. Here, we will use long division:\n\n1. **Divide 1804 by 82**:\n   - 82 goes into 180 (the first three digits of 1804) 2 times (since \\(82 \\times 2 = 164\\)).\n   - Subtract 164 from 180 to get 16.\n   - Bring down the next digit (4) to make it 164.\n   - 82 goes into 164 2 times (since \\(82 \\times 2 = 164\\)).\n   - Subtract 164 from 164 to get 0.\n\nSo, \\(1804 \\div 82 = 22\\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nAfter performing the division, we find that each friend will receive 22 cookies. \n\n### Final Answer\nThus, each of Chris's 82 friends will get **22 cookies**.", "feedback": "No", "suggestion": "give me the clear and concise example", "refined_answer": "Each of Chris's 82 friends will get **22 cookies**."}
